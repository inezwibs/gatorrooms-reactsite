-General rules for complex (compound) statements:

    Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
    Use one space before the opening bracket.
    Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
    Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

-Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:

    Variable and function names written as camelCase
    Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
    Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE


-If you have internal state and/or refs, prefer class extends React.Component over React.createClass. eslint: react/prefer-es6-class react/prefer-stateless-function

-Follow these alignment styles for JSX syntax. eslint: react/jsx-closing-bracket-location react/jsx-closing-tag-location

-Always use camelCase for prop names.
